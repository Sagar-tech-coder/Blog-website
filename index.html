              <p>
                Humayun's Tomb, located in Delhi, India, is a masterpiece of

                design. Its symmetrical structure, grand arched entrances, and
                meticulously landscaped Charbagh (four-part garden) set the
                stage for the later construction of the Taj Mahal.
